                    <h2>Erosion Control</h2>
                    <p>EPA regulations and other laws require each project to have erosion controls to prevent possible pollutants from entering storm drains, nearby streams or impacting other areas. The Boss team ensures your project stays compliant with EPA regulations and local building codes. We begin by assessing the nature of the land to evaluate the needs for your project. Our team will then install erosion and sediment controls such as silt fencing, inlet protections, and blankets to prevent any water erosion. Our experience, combined with state-of-the-art equipment turns your job site and project from potentially hazardous to environmentally friendly.</p>

                    <h2>Earth Work & Grading</h2>
                    <p>It's more than moving dirt. Having a stable surface to start on is essential to beginning any construction project. Sub-optimal workmanship can create costly issues down the road including soil and rock creep, settlement, and problems with surface drainage. Trust Boss to complete your earth work and grading so that you don't pay for it later. From completely redesigning the landscape of the site to creating a level area to lay your foundation, we will make sure you can build whatever you have planned knowing the base is solid. Our team will adapt to whatever the site has in store for us—we have the experience and skill to tackle every site condition. We use a modern grading system that includes tools like GPS grading devices and advanced equipment to reach the level you need in order to start building.</p>

                    <h2>Sewers</h2>
                    <p>Pipe systems, including main and lateral lines, storm drains and sanitary sewers play a vital role in the construction of any residential or commercial building project. If installed improperly, problems can arise and sewers and drainage can be costly to repair or replace once the building is there. Trust our safe and accurate team to install it correctly, prior to building. Installing pipe systems starts with measuring, determining slope and then digging the trench and laying the pipe. We take these necessary steps to make sure the installed system flows properly and is less susceptible to damage over time from freezing, groundwater, or soil changes.</p>
