                <h2>A Family Business With 100+ Years Of Combined Experience</h2>
                    <p>One man, one truck, and a vision. In 1984, our founder Jerry had a vision and a passion. Jerry had been raised in a construction family. Jerry's father worked in the excavation field all his life and encouraged Jerry to tag along with him as he went to construction sites throughout the region. It was only natural that Jerry would enter the construction industry when he began his own career. All these years later, he's still here.</p>
                    <p>Jerry loved trucking and moving dirt. He started Precision Excavating very humbly, with a single dump truck. Against all odds and through sheer determination and dedication, his little company began to take shape. One truck led to two, then his first employee and the dye was cast. Jerry's fleet of trucks grew, as did the type and size of equipment.</p>
                    <p>Today Precision Excavating operates in Hunterdon, Warren, Mercer and Somerset counties. We specialize in these areas and are familiar in code enforcement, zoning, planning and more. </p>
                    <p>As a result of its focus on quality, on time performance and cost effective pricing, Precision Excavating is enjoying steady growth in all of its market segments. This growth has allowed Precision Excavating to attract the best talent in the region, making our team the envy of the industry.</p>
                    <p>In order to keep up with the demand for its services, Precision Excavating has been acquiring new and more efficient capital equipment. Whether it’s pavement demolition, earth moving, excavation or snow removal we have the right piece of equipment to do the job. No job is too large, too small, or too complex for Precision Excavating.</p>
                    <p>Jerry started with traditional values and we still live by them today such as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Safety First</li>
                        <li>Do it right the first time</li>
                        <li>Do it on time</li>
                        <li>Provide unsurpassed value to our clients</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Precision Excavating has been providing excavation services since 1984. It has never failed to complete a contract and stands ready to perform for you.</p>
                    <p>Team Precision: your construction partner.</p>

                <h4>The Beginning</h4>
                <p>It all started in January, 1984. Jerry our founder, started with a simple plowing contract for a local quick stop at the time. Starting out with a one man crew and a pickup truck, it wasn’t easy to get the ball rolling. Early on, there were many struggles and obstacles Jerry had to overcome single handedly. Through the rain, cold, snow and blazing heat, Jerry kept looking forward with a vision of where we are now. All odds were against him, it’s been a long tough road, but he passed on to us his unstoppable determination which makes us who we are today. We never give up and always find a solution to every problem we are faced with no matter how hard things become sometimes. </p>

                <h4>Fleet of 4</h4>
                <p>In 1996, we now had 4 pieces of equipment, 5 employees and steady work. By this time we successfully built a solid reputation for our meticulous work and our determination to work closely with our clients to get the job done right the first time. At precision excavating, we don’t believe a client is just another person we are doing a job for. We believe our clients are everything. We take the time to understand exactly what they want and we deliver the result. </p>

                <h4>Breaking Ground For New HQ</h4>
                <p>It was not long ago that we broke ground for our new headquarters. Looking back to how the company started in a small tool shed trying to make ends meet, this was a big step for us to becoming who we are and helping our company grow to help meet the demands for every client. </p>

                <p>It was in April of 2015 that we acquired 5 pieces of equipment ranging from excavators to wood chippers. It’s very important to have various pieces of equipment so we can work with almost every client even on odds jobs that require specialty machines. </p>
